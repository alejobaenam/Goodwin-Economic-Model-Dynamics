# Goodwin Economic Model in Dynamic Systems

This repository provides simulations and analyses of the Goodwin growth-cycle model, a cornerstone in economic dynamics. The focus is on understanding and evaluating this nonlinear dynamic system through modeling, simulation, and in-depth system analysis. This work is part of a course on dynamic systems and covers two main practices: the modeling and simulation of a nonlinear dynamic system and an extensive analysis of its behavior, sensitivity, and stability.


## Folders Structure

- **Delivery1 - Modeling & Simulation**: Contains the model simulation and results from the first practice, including system modeling, simulation under various inputs, and graphical analysis.
  
- **Delivery2 - Stability & Sensitivity Analysis**: Includes the second practice focused on the analysis of the dynamic system, stability, sensitivity, uncertainty analysis, and comparison between linear and nonlinear models.

## Requirements

- MATLAB with Simulink (for modeling and simulation)
- MATLAB Live Script for documentation and results presentation
- Simulink models for system simulation, linearization, and stability analysis
- GSUA tool for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Goodwin-Model-Dynamics.git
```

2. Open the MATLAB project and run the scripts and Simulink models for each section.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary toolboxes installed in MATLAB for Simulink, sensitivity analysis, and linearization.

## Practice Deliveries

### 1. **Nonlinear-System-Modeling-Simulation**

This section involves the modeling and simulation of a nonlinear dynamic system. Key tasks include:

- Creating a system model and simulating the system under various input conditions.
- Generating results and graphs for input variations (constant, sinusoidal, and pulsed inputs).
- Exploring the effects of parameter changes on system behavior.

### 2. **Nonlinear-System-Analysis**

This section focuses on the analysis of the nonlinear dynamic system:

- Linearity analysis and comparison between linear and nonlinear models.
- Stability analysis using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.
- Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using the GSUA method.
- Model validation with simulations and comparison with literature.

## How to Use

1. Open the Simulink models (`Modelo.slx`, `Modelo_linmod.slx`, etc.) to explore different simulations.
2. Use the Live Scripts (`Practica1.mlx`, `Informe.mlx`) for detailed results, including graphs and analysis.
3. Adjust parameters in the Simulink models and run simulations to study system behavior under different conditions.
